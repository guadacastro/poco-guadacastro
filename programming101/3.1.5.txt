Ex. 3.1.5 (*)
Combine Ex. 3.1.2 and 3.1.4 into one program.
The program should ask the user if they want to add or subtract two numbers. Then the program should ask
for the two numbers and print the result.


- first we ask if we want to add(input = 0) or substract( input = 1)
- then we ask to input 2 numbers.
- we check if they are actually numbers

input = input 0 if you want to add or 1 if you want to substract the numbers
num1 = input number 1
num2 = input number 2

total= 0

IF ((num1 is not an int) OR (num2 is not and int))
    PRINT These are not numbers. Please input again.
    num1 = input number 1
    num2 = input number 2

# substract
IF (input == 1) :
    IF (num1 IS GREATER OR EQUAL num2):
        total = num1 - num2

    ELSE (num2 IS GREATER THAN num1):
        total = num2 - num1

ELSE IF (input == 0 )
    total = num1 + num 2

print => The answer is, total
