Ex. 3.1.3 (*) - Which number is bigger? ca. 15 min
Declare 2 variables, both numbers. Compare which number is greater Log the output, 
e.g. "The greater number
of 5 and 10 is 10." Add an output for the else statement, 
e.g. "The smaller number of 5 and 10 is 5."


- create 2 variables for the numbers
- add a conditional to check which number is bigger and also check if the are equal
- depending on each condition, we need to print which number is greater, smaller or equal

num1 = input('Input number A:')
num2 = input('Input number B:')

IF (num1 IS GREATER THAN num2):

    PRINT => num1 is greater than num2

ELSE IF (num2 IS GREATER THAN num1): 

    PRINT => num2 is greater than num1

ELSE
    PRINT => num1 & num2 are the same number
