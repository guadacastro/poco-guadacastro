Ex. 3.1.4 (*) - Subtract numbers 
Allow the user to input numbers, subtract the smaller from the bigger number and print the result.

- first we add the variables num1 and num2 and the variable for the answer (total)
- on each variable we put an input so the user can input the numbers.
- check which number is smaller so we know which number we need to substract
- when we know that, we make the subtract in the total variable
- then we print the final answer (total)


num1 = input number 1
num2 = input number 2

total = 0

IF (num1 IS GREATER OR EQUAL num2):
    total = num1 - num2
ELSE (num2 IS GREATER THAN num1):
    total = num2 - num1

PRINT => The answer is: total
